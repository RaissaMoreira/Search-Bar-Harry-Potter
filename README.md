# :zap: Search Bar - Harry Potter :zap:
:mag_right: Search for characters from the Harry Potter and see some details about them.

:books: The Search Bar was made with the intention to study API request in javascript. Built using HTML, CSS, JS and  [Harry Potter API](http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters) :zap: to search/filter Harry Potter characters.
There are some things that I learned:

 - Async/Await
 - String **`join()`** to join all the element strings;
- **`json()`** method;
- Arrow Function syntax;
- JavaScript array **`filter()`** method;
- Case insensitive search (**`toLowerCase()`**).
